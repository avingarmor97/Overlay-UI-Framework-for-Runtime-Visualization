## 🧩 Overview

**Overlay UI Framework** is a modular, cross-platform C++ system designed to render non-invasive runtime visual interfaces.  
It supports visualization of simulated data, diagnostics, and internal metrics using a customizable overlay window.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🖥️ Transparent runtime overlay with DirectX support  
- 🧩 IMGUI-based user interface for dynamic visualization  
- ⚙️ Modular structure — add your own display modules  
- 🎛️ Keyboard interaction for toggling panels  
- 🔍 Suitable for simulation metrics, developer HUDs, performance overlays  
- 🧱 Written in C++17 — fully open-source
